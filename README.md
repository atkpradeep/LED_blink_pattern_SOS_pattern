# LED_blink_pattern_SOS_pattern
Arduino example for LED blink pattern (SOS pattern) Three short blink followed by three long blink and so on

create sketch to set blink SOS pattern (three short blink, followed by three long blinks,
followed again by three short ones).

Ex 1: Create the sketch to modify the blink pattern. Try to see if you can
make it blink in an SOS pattern (three short blink, followed by three long blinks,
followed again by three short ones).

Ex 2: Create the sketch to blink the LEDs in a series lighting pattern. From a state in which
LEDs are completely off, turn each LED on one after the other with a 500 millisecond
gap until all LEDs are lit. Then turn them all off after a 500-millisecond gap and repeat.
